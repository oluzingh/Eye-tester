Enabling and consultation for eye weakness

This code creates a window with a canvas to display letters randomly chosen from a list. The user clicks on the canvas to indicate that they can no longer see the letter clearly, and the font size is reduced until a new letter is displayed. This process repeats indefinitely to test the user's visual acuity.
